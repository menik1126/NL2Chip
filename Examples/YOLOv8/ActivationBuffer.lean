  Activation Double Buffer -- Signal DSL

  Ping-pong buffer using two memory banks. While one bank is being
  written (current layer output), the other is read (next layer input).
  The `bufferSel` signal swaps banks between layers.

/-- Ping-pong double buffer for activation data.

    Two memory banks, selected by `bufferSel`:
    - bufferSel=false: write to bank0, read from bank1
    - bufferSel=true:  write to bank1, read from bank0

    Parameters:
      - writeAddr: write address (20-bit, supports up to 1M entries)
      - readAddr:  read address
      - writeData: INT8 data to write
      - writeEn:   write enable
      - bufferSel: which buffer to write to (toggle between layers)

    Returns: INT8 read data from the non-writing bank
