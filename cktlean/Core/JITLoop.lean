  JITLoop — JIT-accelerated Signal.loopMemo replacement

  Provides `Signal.loopMemoJIT` with the same `IO (Signal dom α)` API as
  `loopMemo`, but uses JIT-compiled C++ under the hood for ~200x speedup.

  Also provides `JIT.run` for streaming mode (O(1) memory) for long runs.

  **Design principle**: Read values via explicitly named output wires
  (`JIT.getWire` with stable names that feed the top-level output),
  not via `getOutput` (192-bit packed output is skipped by CppSim backend).

  Usage:
    let soc ← Signal.loopMemoJIT
      (jitCppPath := "verilator/generated_soc_jit.cpp")
      (wireNames := #["_gen_pcReg", "_gen_uartValidBV", ...])
      (loadMem := fun h => ...)
      (reconstruct := fun _h vals => pure (mkMyResult vals))

/-- JIT-accelerated loopMemo replacement using named output wires.
    Returns IO (Signal dom α) that reads from JIT simulation.

    Parameters:
    - `jitCppPath`: Path to the pre-generated `*_jit.cpp` file
    - `wireNames`: Array of `_gen_*` wire names to read each cycle.
      Use wires that feed the top-level output — they are stable
      (not affected by DCE or name collisions on internal state).
    - `loadMem`: Optional callback to load firmware/data into JIT memories
    - `reconstruct`: Converts wire values (UInt64 array, indexed by wireNames)
      into the result type `α` -/

/-- Run JIT simulation for up to `cycles` cycles with a per-cycle callback.
    No state caching — O(1) memory. The callback receives the cycle number
    and an array of wire values (indexed by wireNames order).
    Return `false` from the callback to stop early.

    Parameters:
    - `handle`: Pre-loaded JIT handle
    - `cycles`: Maximum number of cycles to run
    - `wireIndices`: Pre-resolved wire indices (from JIT.findWire)
    - `callback`: Called each cycle with (cycle, wireValues); return false to stop -/
def JIT.run (handle : JITHandle) (cycles : Nat)
    (wireIndices : Array UInt32)
    (callback : Nat → Array UInt64 → IO Bool)
    : IO Unit := do
  for cycle in [:cycles] do
    JIT.evalTick handle
    let vals ← wireIndices.mapM fun idx =>
      JIT.getWire handle idx
    let continue_ ← callback cycle vals
    if !continue_ then return

/-- Resolve an array of wire names to their JIT indices.
    Throws if any wire name is not found. -/
def JIT.resolveWires (handle : JITHandle) (wireNames : Array String) : IO (Array UInt32) := do
  wireNames.mapM fun name => do
    match ← JIT.findWire handle name with
    | some idx => pure idx
    | none => throw (IO.userError s!"JIT.resolveWires: wire '{name}' not found")

/-- Resolve an array of register names to their JIT indices.
    Throws if any register name is not found. -/
def JIT.resolveRegs (handle : JITHandle) (regNames : Array String) : IO (Array UInt32) := do
  regNames.mapM fun name => do
    match ← JIT.findReg handle name with
    | some idx => pure idx
    | none => throw (IO.userError s!"JIT.resolveRegs: register '{name}' not found")

/-- Run JIT simulation with an oracle callback for cycle-skipping.
    Same as `JIT.run` but with an additional `oracle` that receives
    the JITHandle directly and can manipulate JIT state (setReg, memsetWord)
    before returning a skip count.

    Parameters:
    - `handle`: Pre-loaded JIT handle
    - `cycles`: Maximum number of cycles to run
    - `wireIndices`: Pre-resolved wire indices (from JIT.resolveWires)
    - `oracle`: Called each cycle with (handle, cycle, wireValues); return
      `some skipCount` to skip forward (oracle handles its own state mutations),
      or `none` for normal tick.
    - `callback`: Called each cycle with (cycle, wireValues); return false to stop

    Returns: the number of cycles actually executed -/

      JIT.tick handle
      cycle := cycle + 1
    | some skipCount =>
      cycle := cycle + (max skipCount 1)
